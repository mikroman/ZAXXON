This repo contains the Commodore64 version Zaxxon cartridge disassembly. KickAss format.

The .crt has two banks and three files. The three assembly files are first built with Kick Assembler into binfiles. A bat file then merges these three into one 20KB binfile. Then VICE, cartconv.exe, converts that binfile into a zaxxon type crt file. This can then be launched with; either VICE emulator, or c64debugger.
