This repo contains the Commodore64 version Zaxxon cartridge disassembly. KickAss format.

The .crt has three files in two banks. The three assembly files are first built with Kick Assembler into binfiles. A bat file then merges these three into one 20KB binfile. Then VICE's cartconv.exe converts that binfile into a zaxxon type .crt file. This can then be launched within by; either VICE emulator, or c64debugger.
